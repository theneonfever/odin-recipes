        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This pizza is simple yet surprisingly delicious. Using
            sourdough means it's also easier on your stomach.

            Since we have so few ingredients, make sure you get the best
            possible. In fact, you should probably travel to Italy to buy
            your mozzarella.
